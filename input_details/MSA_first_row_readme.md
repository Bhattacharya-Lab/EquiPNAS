Download and install ColabFold from [here](https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabFold/)

Run `ColabFold/colabfold/batch.py` with `--save-pair-representations` parameter, and save the representation ``result["representations"]["msa_first_row"]`` in npy format. That's the msa first row feature.

An example of MSA first row feature can be found [here](../Preprocessing/input/4zm2_Bmsa_first_row.npy)
